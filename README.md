# Unofficial UTRGV Thesis Template

[![Lint and Build LaTeX document](https://github.com/UTRGV-SMSS/Thesis-Template/actions/workflows/compile.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/UTRGV-SMSS/Thesis-Template/actions/workflows/compile.yml)

This is a LaTeX thesis template that attempts to conform to the 
[Thesis Guide](https://www.utrgv.edu/graduate/_files/documents/thesis-formatting-guide-september-2021.pdf)
published by the UTRGV Graduate College.

If you have a question, please submit your question as an issue here:
[https://github.com/UTRGV-SMSS/Thesis-Template/issues](https://github.com/UTRGV-SMSS/Thesis-Template/issues). 
You should also read through the issues listed there to see if they match the question you have.


## Getting Started

To use this template, download as a zip file  from [Github](https://github.com/UTRGV-SMSS/Thesis-Template/archive/master.zip).  Optionally, you can upload this zip file to [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) to get started right away.

After unzipping you should see many files, but the most important files are the 
`main.tex` file and the `UTRGV.cls` file.
The main formatting commands are defined in the `UTRGV.cls` file.  However, it
is likely that you
will not need to modify or even look at the contents of this file.

To really get started, open the `main.tex` file and start editing.  This file is mostly
self-documenting.  Look at the comments in this file for directions on how to
produce the desired content and formatting of your thesis. 

Apart from the commands documented in the `main.tex` file, try to use the
regular LaTeX formatting commands.  Avoid loading packages that change the
layout of your document.

Here is a link on how to split your thesis up into several files:
[https://web.science.mq.edu.au/~rdale/resources/writingnotes/latexstruct.html](https://web.science.mq.edu.au/~rdale/resources/writingnotes/latexstruct.html)


## Common Issues


1. **Font is Not Times New Roman**:  When compiling with LaTeX (or pdfLaTeX) your paper will be typeset with a font that is almost
identical to Times New Roman but is not actually named that.  To typeset your
paper with Times New Roman, change the compiler that your editor uses from LaTeX (or pdfLaTeX) to XeLaTeX.  
2. **Figures Do Not Show Up**: When compiling in draft mode, figures do not show and you will also see red labels
on equations and figures.
To have the figures show and the red labels disappear, change the `\documentclass` options from `draft` to
`final`.
3. **Table of Contents is titled "Contents" instead of "TABLE OF CONTENTS” and need to change "Chapter I" to "CHAPTER I"**: This issue is most likely caused by the Babel package, which is probably not needed.  If so, remove the line with “\usepackage{babel}”
3. **Compiling for PhD dissertation**: To compile for a PhD dissertation, you can change the `\documentclass` options from `masters` to `phd`.  Alternatively, you can use the following code in your `main.tex` file.
```latex
\degree{Doctor of Philosophy}
\degreeabbrev{(PhD)}
\docname{Dissertation}
```
4. **Compiling for a Master of Arts Thesis**:
To compile for a  Master of Arts thesis use the following code in `main.tex`

```latex
\degree{Master of Arts}
\degreeabbrev{(MA)}
\docname{Thesis}
``` 
5. **Text Needs to be Aligned Left instead of Justified**: Sometimes a reviewer
   will ask that the text of your thesis be Aligned Left (which is the default
in Microsoft Word) instead of Justified (which is the default in LaTeX).  To
switch to Aligned Left, uncomment the line with `\usepackage[document]{ragged2e}` in `main.tex` to
activate Aligned Left.
6. **Bibliography Requires Hanging Indentation**:  Sometimes a reviewer will ask
   that the entries of your Bibliography have hanging indentation after the
first line. To enable
this, add the lines below to the file `main.tex`  before the beginning of the
bibliography code. You can adjust the size of the indentation by changing `2em`
to a more suitable value.
```latex
\makeatletter
\def\bibhanging{2em}
\let\old@biblabel\@biblabel
\def\@biblabel#1{\old@biblabel{#1}\kern\bibhanging}
\let\old@bibitem\bibitem
\def\bibitem#1{\old@bibitem{#1}\leavevmode\kern-\bibhanging}
\makeatother
``` 
7. **Want to Use Special Environments for Thereoms**: If you want to use special environments for theroems, propositions, proofs, and other similar environments, add code similar to below to the file `main.tex`. See the documentation for the  `amsthm` package for further customization.
```latex
\usepackage{amsthm}
\newtheorem{prop}{Proposition}
\renewcommand{\theprop}{\thechapter{}.\arabic{prop}}
```
8. **Reviewer Asks to Modify Spacing**: Sometimes a reviewer will ask you modify spacing in some part of the document.  For example, if a reviewer asks you decrease the space between the lines in the copyright page, modify the file `UTRGVthesis.cls` by changing the line
```latex
Copyright~\UTRGVField@Year~\UTRGVField@Author \\
```
to something similar to
```latex
Copyright~\UTRGVField@Year~\UTRGVField@Author \\[-1mm]
```
where you will need to judge the length needed.  Unfortunately, the changes asked by reviewers are unpredictable.  Otherwise, this template would be modified to accommodate them.

9. **Captions are aligned to the left**: The September 2021 revision of Thesis Guide states on page 15 that figures and tables should be left-aligned and not centered.  The `caption` package is loaded in the class file to align the captions to the left to match the alignment of figures and tables.

10. **List of Figures and List of Tables must only contain the first sentence of Figure/Table caption**: If your Figure(s) and/or Table(s) contain more than one sentences in its caption, only the first sentence must be included in the List of Figures and List of Tables. To do this, in your figure or table environment edit the \caption{} as follows.

```\caption[<First sentence>]{Full caption.}``` 

This will keep the Full caption in the Figure/Table but only add the first sentence to the LoF and LoT. 

11. **Long Chapter names**: Splitting long chapter names across multiple lines using newline commands also splits them in the corresponding TOC entry. To fix this use, 

```\chapter[<Chapter Name without newline characters>]{Chapter name with newline characters as needed}``` 

This will ensure that the chapter name doesn't have any newline characters in the TOC but have them in the chapter title page as needed.
